# Azure-Intersite-Connectivity
This lab demonstrates how to implement intersite connectivity in Azure using virtual network peering and gateway transit. It simulates a real-world scenario where core IT services must securely communicate with manufacturing systems across segmented VNets. Key tasks include VM deployment, network diagnostics, peering configuration, and UDR.
